# Is-My-Company-Notable-Enough-to-Be-on-Wikipedia-
In the past few decades, Wikipedia has become one of the most popular online encyclopedic sources. Since the website's articles constantly show up among the top searches on search engines like Google, many business owners strive to get their enterprise on the website. The question that Wikipedia page creation agencies get asked most by potential clients is: How can I meet the notability criteria for Wikipedia? And are there any loopholes in creating a Wikipedia page about your company? <br>

While Wikipedia does have many loopholes, it is important to remember that getting your business on Wikipedia is not an easy mission. <br>

The creation of a Wikipedia page is based on true facts and figures with citations and sources of news or publications on the subject that prove that the subject is notable. Before evaluating the notability of your company, first, let us understand what the factors of notability are. <br>

There are five factors of subject notability on Wikipedia. These are evaluated separately and independently to determine the notability of the subject: <br>

1. Significant coverage of the subject: If you approach a <a href="https://www.hatsoffdigital.com/services/wikipedia-page-creation/">Wikipedia page creation agency</a>, the first thing they will inquire about is if your business has significant coverage. Having significant coverage shows that your topic meets notability guidelines. While having a Wikipedia page can help improve your business’s search engine rankings, the reality is that only a small percentage of businesses are eligible for a page on the website. <br>

2. Multiple Qualifying sources on the subject. You need multiple sources that discuss the subject in detail, and passing mentions, directory listings, or other old things with the topic’s name do not count. <br>

3. Independent sources covering the topic. The sources that talk about the subject must be independent. Articles that are written by the subject (including interviews) or made by someone related to their organization, like their employees, clients, or the subject themselves, do not count as an independent source. Nor does a press release written by a publicist puts a positive light on the subject and omits negative aspects. <br>

4. Sources covering the subject must be reliable. The sources that cover the subject must be reliable; this means that the publisher has a reputation for fact-checking, and an editor must approve the text before its printing. This includes books from reputable publishing houses, mainstream newspapers, or other periodicals. Tabloids, discussion boards, fan sites, Facebook, YouTube, or most blogs do not qualify as reliable. <br>

Wikipedia does not have information on everything. Instead, editors compile subjects from various sources that they see as reliable. <br>

Contrary to popular belief, internet fame is not required for Wikipedia notability. Internet fame comes and goes within hours. YouTubers, Instagrammers, and viral hits may enjoy brief periods of the spotlight, and this does not make them Wikipedia-worthy. Being famous due to a single event does not make someone notable as far as Wikipedia is concerned. <br>

Being relevant in your field also does not make you notable for a Wikipedia page. A journalist quoting an expert opinion from you or an employee commenting on a trending topic is a way of being relevant. Yet, these mentions do not count when it comes to encyclopedic notability. There is nothing that Wikipedia page creation services can do with these mentions and bylines. <br>

**How can a professional Wikipedia page creation agency create pages for notable companies?** <br>

Wikipedia editors easily spot paid content as it is sourced from bylines, mentions, and weak sources. Your business must be featured in the press, on social media, or in newspapers, and it must also have a significant reputation in its industry. <br>

The best way to get your business listed on Wikipedia is to reach a certain level of notability in your industry. Unlike online directories, Wikipedia is not a tool to build notability. It just adds to your notability. <br>
Secondly, you have to depend on a Wikipedia page creation service that can handle the page creation process for you. The agencies will help you create an article that sticks to facts without any persuasive language. <br>

An active Wikipedia page is a plus point for any business. A Wikipedia article can raise brand awareness and reach potential customers in ways traditional marketing cannot do. It also adds to your Google results quite well. <br>
